This project is a small game that was made in class in a few hours using only vanilla JS.

## Rules

This game is played with two players:

* The player that controls the duck with the directionnal arrows from the keyboard.
* The other player that plays as the hunter, with the mouse.

You have up to 60 seconds to avoid gun shots / hit the duck many times as possible. If the hunter shoots the duck, he wins one point, if he misses, he loses one point.
